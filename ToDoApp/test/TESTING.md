# UNIT_TESTING
- Involves testing individual components or units of the software in isolation from the rest of the application.
- Validates that each unit of the software performs as designed.
- Unit = Testable part of the application
- Developer write unit tests during the development phase
- Tests are automated and executed by a testing framework (PyTest).
- Benefits is to identify bugs early in the development process.


# INTEGRATION TESTING
- Focusws on testing the interactions between different units or components of the piece of software.
- The scope is broader than unit testing, as we are testing multiple units together.
- Helps identify probelms for the entire solution.
- Example: Call an API endpoint and make sure the correct solution is retuned
